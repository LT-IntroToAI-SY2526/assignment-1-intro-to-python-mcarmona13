# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

    Python was challenging at first. It looked different from Java last year's programming class, but I started to see the connections. The string methods like ".split()" were new but helpful once I figured them out. 

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses. 

    My prompt was "I'm a high school student learnign Python basics, give me 6 practice problems covering variables, conditionals, loops, and functions." Being specific about my level helped me get appropriate problems. 

    When stuck, I asked specific questions like "how do I check if somehting is a palindrome?" instead of asking for whole solutions. The input/output examples were very helpful for testing. 

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

    Hardest parts: 
     - String manipulation (cleaning punctuation, checking palindromes) 
     - organizing data into dictionaries
     - Prime number algorithms
    
    AI broke things into steps> For plaindromes, it explained using [::-1] to reverse strings. For primes, it explained checking only up to the square root


4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?

    Best strategies:
     - Try solving it myself first, then ask for help on specific parts
     - Ask "why this doesn't work?" not just "whats the answer"
     - Also ask if they're simplier/faster ways to print something clean
     - Test, fix my own bugs
